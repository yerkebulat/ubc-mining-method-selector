This software is based on the mining method selection methodology described in:

   Design and Operation of Caving and Sublevel Stoping Mines, Chapter 4,
   pp. 39-53.

The scoring weights used in this software were extracted from the UBC Mining
Method Selector Excel spreadsheet (v1.1.0) implemented by Jeff Breadner (1999).
